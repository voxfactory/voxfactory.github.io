      My Process
    </h1>
    <h2>
    The process of getting your voxel is easy, simple, and quick.
  </h2>
  <h3> Here's how it works! </h3>
  <p> First, you email me under the Order Voxel link. Include all of the details that you'd like so I can make my drafts as accurate as possible. </p>
  <p> When I finish the drafts (allow 1-3 days) I will send you images of all of the voxel via email (the one you contacted me with). </p>
  <p> Either you'll send back edit requests or be happy with the voxel. I will do the edits and send it back again.</p>
  <p> Once you're happy, you'll pay me the requested amount either in Bitcoin (receive via email), PayPal* (email), or at gumroad.com/voxfactory * (buy at any time, custom orders will be uploaded).</p>
  <br>
  <p> * = Gumroad and PayPal will have extra charges because of the commision they take. It will be around $0.40.
