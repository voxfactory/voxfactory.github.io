      Bluefield Apartments
    </h2>
    <p> A quick apartment building, using glass for the windows and light on the inside. This is my way of creating a more traditionally styled building, I hope you like it! This took a bit of time but was all done in one day. If you want these images and the .obj (3d printing, manipulating) and the .vox (edit in voxel) please purchase this on gumroad.com/voxfactory</p>

      Vox Factory Logo
    </h2>
    <p> I created this logo quickly to show what five minutes on MagicaVoxel could do and to highlight the glow features that you could add into your voxel.
