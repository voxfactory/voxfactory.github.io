      Pricing - Save tons on great designs.
    </h1>
    <p>
      I have a pretty simple pricing system. It's cheaper than most professional designs (by a long shot) but will still get you a great result.
    </p>
    <p>Small Design: 40x40x40 vox or less. $0.15 each</p>
    <p>Medium Design: Between 40x40x40 and 60x60x60. $0.20 each</p>
    <p>Large Design: Over 60x60x60. $0.25 for up to 70x70x70, and then + 5 cents for each one after. (e.g. 80x80x80 = $0.30)</p>
    <p>You can also spice up your designs, with stuff like glass, metal, and light. Add $0.05 to each voxel with the effects.</p>
    <p>You pay a starting price of $0.50 for the first seven models, then $0.40 for 8-10, $0.30 for 11-13, $0.20 for 14-16, and no starting charge for more than 16.</p>
    <p> If you do have to pay, please do so in Bitcoin to this address: 1Bxci9pezJAsZeZHHpNvspF5dfkQjYeA5d </p>
