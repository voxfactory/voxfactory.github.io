      Need a voxel art job done? I'll do it! I use MagicaVoxel to create designs that I'm
      sure you'll love. The entire process is customized, from the voxel request to the finishing
      touches, and it's all really cheap - most of the time, you'll get it all done under $5.00.
      I hope that you choose me as your quick go-to graphics creator.

      You might not be too comfortable - after all, this is a GitHub website and I don't own
      anything professional. That's why you don't have to pay until I'm done. I will send you images
      of the voxel structures as I develop them and when I'm done, if you like them you can pay me and
      I'll send you the downloadable version.
